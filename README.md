# Hello, this is Tanaka Asande Mlambo
This Repository showcases the multiple of my AWS projects.

## üë®‚Äçüíª  AWS-Projects:

### Monitoring-Infrastructure:
  - In this project, I used Systems Manager to install the CloudWatch agent on an EC2 instance. I configured it to collect both application and system metrics. I created a real-time notification that informed me when an instance was stopped or terminated. Activated AWS Config rules to ensure compliance with tagging and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

### Testing-VPC-Connectivity-and-troubleshooting-connection-issues:
  - In this project, I created a secure VPC where I launched 2 EC2 instances in a private and public subnet. I then tested connectivity and troubleshoot issues with connectivity using the EC2 instances.

### Cloud-Security-with-AWS-IAM:
